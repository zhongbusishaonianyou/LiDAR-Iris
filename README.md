# LiDAR Iris for Loop-Closure Detection
# matlab_version
- We replicated this method in MATLAB.Since the IRIS descriptor has a higher dimension and there is no efficient loop closure frame matching method,this method has poor real-time performance and is rather time-consuming during both testing and operation.
